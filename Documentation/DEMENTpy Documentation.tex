\section{Structure}
DEMENTpy is an individual-based model of microbial systems that is spatially explicit and trait-based, which is built from the bottom up from gene and metabolism through community all the way up to system-level emergent functions.

\subsection{Modelling Unit}
The modelling unit in DEMENTpy is an individual taxon, which is illustrated as below:

% insert an illustration of model unit--an individual of a taxon




\section{Community Initialization}
This is the foremost step in DEMENTpy, as only after this can a microbial community that can behave be initiated. This step also completely embodies the trait-based approach. In detail, a community of being spatially explicit is created based on various traits under a series of assumptions. These traits and assumptions are elaborated below with examples.

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\emph{Example code can be displayed showing how trait values are drawn from distributions and assigned to different individuals.}}}



\section{Processes}
DEMENTpy is a mechanistically explicit model that encompasses processes including degradation of substrates, uptake of monomers, metabolism, mortality, and reproduction. These processes are introduced as below following the order of implementation in the model.
\subsection{Degradation}

\subsection{Uptake}

\subsection{Metabolism}
DEMENTpy now explicitly calculates metabolic production of transporters, enzymes, and osmolytes. However, it is noteworthy that for each of these three categories, it is still far from being explicit, especially for osmolyte, which, though it is assumed to have differing genes within each individual taxon and among different taxa, has constant stoichiometry without knowing specific osmotic compounds.

As regards enzyme, different taxa produce different enzymes that have differing kinetic parameters. These different enzymes still have the same stoichiometry, but entail differing metabolic costs for production by different taxa. 

Similar to enzyme, ...

\subsection{Mortality}
Mortality is implemented in DEMENTpy as both a deterministic and a stochastic process. Firstly, a microbial cell dies when its mass reaches a threshold value. In the current version of DEMENTpy the threshold value is assumed to be a constant among taxa. In addition, microbial cells die from a stochastic process, which is, atop a basal mortality probability (differentiated between bacteria and fungi), constrained by drought intensity and drought tolerance, and functional group. These two processes are executed with the deterministic process preceding the stochastic one. The mortality probability is calculated following:

Parameters involved in this mortality process include:
